# Liver Cirrhosis Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Description

This project implements a Flask-based web application for predicting liver cirrhosis stages based on patient data. It utilizes machine learning models trained on a dataset containing relevant clinical features.

## Features

- Web-based interface for data input and predictions.
- Flask backend for processing and model inference.
- Data preprocessing using SMOTE for handling class imbalance.
- Multiple models compared for accuracy and performance.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open a web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## Dependencies

Ensure the following Python packages are installed:

- Flask
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)
- Jupyter Notebook (for working with `.ipynb` files)

Install missing dependencies using:

```sh
pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn jupyter
```
